A test to get to know GitHub

Hey there friend!

Jon Jav is in the house yo. I am interested to know more about the world of programming and development in Web and Software. (Thats what I truly truly spend time)
Anyway. Ive managed to enter into Version Control (I dont know what it is) and I stumble upon this Github. It is really interesting.
By the way. I also create and edit videos as a hobby. Ive established my interest group (Soon to be a production team) Videogrammer. Which is some kind of my theraphy to solve the ailments of our depression as milennials. I mean I use it as my purpose in life.
In the next 10 years this would be one of the greatest and wonderful forward-looking sought-after creative agencies in the world which helps beautify and vamp up our lifestyle in delivering content in Television, print, and in Technology.
TPT.
Im glad and very hopeful that undergoing its odds would be very challenging and totally unique and unexpected. Because we expect to be unexpected and learning is king
